# Multi-Database API with Node.js and Express

This project demonstrates how to build an Express.js API that connects to **two separate MongoDB databases**:

- `employees_db`: Stores employee details
- `products_db`: Stores product details

It includes an API endpoint that fetches and returns **combined data** from both databases.
